In the faint distance you think you hear a tune with a likeness to hit composer Elgar’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enigma Variations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; but, it’s most likely in your imagination. The bustling businesses, noisy traffic, and fast moving surroundings just about polluted all the English air. At this point, Elgar’s brief fame from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enigma</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had little by little died out, leaving the scene of classical music looking bleak; it’s almost certain you were solely hearing music of your own fabrication, from your own desires. However it wasn’t just you who longed to see a revival for classical music in the English lands: so did Gustav Holst. Holst swooped in and dropped his orchestral suite </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this time of scarcity, bringing the wave of refreshment, creativity, and excitement that everybody was anxiously anticipating. Amidst this master of a suite was “Jupiter”, a movement that became the face of the composition, bringing listeners to tears, and growing a name for not only Holst, but for England, and for all of classical music.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this day, classical music still remains in separation from standard pop culture. You don’t hear many people’s favorite music genre to be classical, at least not in public, but classical elements and works have crept into other media that are in fact celebrated and praised amongst society. Movie soundtracks, many of the most well-known being those by mastermind composer John Williams: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars, Harry Potter, Superman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, share the art of classical music to new, unexpected audiences, establishing its presence and place on this planet. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning from the late 1800s, before Holst’s time, Edward Elgar was another English composer, who, too, wrote some of England’s most famous compositions to this day. Amongst his works, “Nimrod” in particular brings out a very comparable emotional depth to what “Jupiter” does. Both are just singular movements within their respective larger works, yet they have a rare, extremely precious ability to truly move and captivate the listener. Listen for the strong, yet harmonious and beautiful tone of the instruments as the sound builds to full, emotional climaxes, and falls to vulnerable, relaxed transition periods. </span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5t9UkwkrumEmOpnz3SRdbm?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In stark contrast to Elgar’s full, layered piece, Johannes Brahms, who was amongst the prominent non-English composers of the late 19th century, brings a piano piece that represents the simple, structured conventions of most compositions of that time. From his famous suite <em>16 Waltzes in </em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A-Flat Major, No.15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is representative of the systematic and not terribly exhilarating flow of music popular during the pre-Holst era of English and European music. Enjoy the serenity of this brief, lullaby-adjacent song, marking stillness and scarcity of the times.</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7ouW02587AzIaGnK0gh8St?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next three songs are all from the orchestral suite </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and represent Holst’s entrance and mark made on music. As context, the suite was written amidst the first world war, so many saw war as a parallel and inspiration for the suite.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opening movement of the orchestral suite is “Mars: the Bringer of War”, a movement that is no short of intensity, mystery, and chaos. For “Mars”, listen to how Holst deviates from a traditional march style, and instead goes for a complex 5/4 time signature, a small peek into all of the artistic choices that he has to offer to the musical world. </span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1C3RIRKQZhSk5d2iioIhkg?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Venus: the Bringer of Peace” is the movement following “Mars” within the same suite, bringing a resolution to the previous statement of war, through the extremely elegant and stripped-back movement. When listening, you can hear the total contrast from “Mars”, with Venus incorporating more solos for a delicate and angelic sound. The entire ambience of the movement embodies the serenity that comes with peace after war.</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0kEBYD0sMCPtsfpwFLG9aj?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the playlist has reached its highest point, reaching my song “Jupiter: the Bringer of Jollity” from Holst’s suite. War, whether during or after the fact, is not seen as a time of joy for many, but “Jupiter” brings the listener past the struggles and damage done by the violence. Featuring some of the most impactful, influential themes and melodies of all time, this song looks towards the positive and represents the unity of the people, along with society’s entrance into a post-war period of flourishment, innovation, and development. Truly let go and appreciate this song, as this movement will take you on a journey, experiencing excitement, genuine happiness, and emotions never before felt from a piece of classical music.</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6nbGJW2ZsD8PgBdwygIu6V?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the premiere of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Holst was asked to adapt “Jupiter” for use in the British hymn that is now known as “I Vow to Thee, My Country”. The tune of the hymn is entirely taken from “Jupiter”, sampling the famous melody of my song, and in turn hugely growing an audience for the tune. This particular song is the only song in this playlist to have lyrics; therefore when listening to the lyrics of the hymn, notice how the melody of “Jupiter” compliments and adds depth to the bold, strong, and unifying words of the chorus. “Jupiter”, by being implemented in a new light in a work far beyond the realm of classical music, reached listeners worldwide.</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4mSXobBfj6GhBgPLvVWgNy?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To close out the playlist, the last song is the end title from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only is this song fit to end the playlist and the story being told within, but this specific song is very aligned to the focus around “Jupiter”. This end title embodies the jollity that Jupiter represents, while also spanning to music from a more present time that carries Holst’s influence into modern times and popular culture. For this one, sit back, listen to the layers of sounds aligning in their perfect arrangements, and feel the closure that this upbeat, positive, and victorious song brings.</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3HjDvnmiTLKaDalq4u2Hem?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feeling of triumph and joy portrayed by the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ending track is one that embodies all of the progress, the success, and the coming possibilities for the genre that is classical music. After having heard a playlist that pushes the upper, lower, left, and right boundaries of sound, emotion, and storytelling, hearing the striking sound of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brings a closure to the long and winding journey that English classical music has so far seen. To reach its level of appreciation and love of the present, classical music has seen, cherished, and remembered composers, producers, filmmakers, and most importantly the ever growing audience it has fostered.</span></p><p class="align-right"><a href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/music-review.html">to "Jupiter's" Reign &gt;&gt;</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
