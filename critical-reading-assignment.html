Greene discusses the orchestral norms that the suite defied and the changes brought upon orchestral music through masterpieces like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with its revolutionary reception and popularity it received globally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this book, the author writes about several different aspects of the history and influence of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as specifically analyzing the composition of “Jupiter: Bringer of Jollity” to explain its ability to capture audiences and news sources globally. In the beginning of the text, Greene establishes the unique qualities of Holst’s work, namely the lack of structure and traditional German style composition, substituted by an arrangement of “musical figures or style[s] to project character” and his reach for “musical communication”, where “basic structures and relationships of the music would take on rhetorical functions; in other words, rather than existing for themselves, they would work as part of a human communication,” (Greene 1995, 3). Holst’s desire to express emotion, character, and sentiment through his work was a major reason for the suite, and specifically “Jupiter’s” success.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene then transitions to documenting and analyzing the trend of reviews that surfaced of the suite dating back to the premiere in the 1920s, using a collection of tables, effectively presenting a range of positive and negative reviews from popular news sources, as well as specific reviews by those same sources, to portray the split public reception of the suite at its debut. Greene uses the news sources’ conflicting and strong comments to emphasize the trailblazing quality of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, truly having soared past the industry’s previous demands and standards for any piece of respected work. With Greene’s analysis of Holst’s musical decisions, the public’s reaction to the atypical composition, all leading to the suite’s eventual rise towards recognition, he was able to present the evolution of classical and orchestral music through the impact and lasting legacy of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author, having dove deep into intricate, specific, components of orchestral suite </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s reception, as well as its contribution within the industry and its musical elements, delivered persuasive arguments in each individual topic. In a plain, straight context, the following statement concerning the lack of true understanding of the piece through just the popular movements could be effective: “It is only with a complete performance, and with a hearing which honors what the music itself has to say, that we can begin to fathom the work as a personal statement by this enigmatic composer,” (Greene 1995, 3). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He even uses reviews to support this idea: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arts Gazette</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reviewer L. Dunton Green “‘early on had written about how disturbed he was that the suite was not being played in its complete form. ‘It was an injustice to the composer to rob his planetary system of the two stars whose soft light would have relieved the fierce glare of the five others,’ (Arts Gazette, 8 March 1919).’” (Greene 1995, 30).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while Greene does support his ideas by quoting reviews and he does present a reasonable argument, he is often found defending multiple sides of the argument and in consequence not establishing a strict focus for the book. He supplies the reader with multitudes of information, quotes, and logical reasoning to support each of his ideas, however, due to the wide range of arguments within the text leading to a less pronounced central idea, the book could easily lose retention of a large portion of readers who were not, for example, anticipating an in-depth, music theory and composition lecture.</span></p><p class="align-right"><a href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/final-major-essay.html">to "I Vow To Thee Our Savior" &gt;&gt;</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
