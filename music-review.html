With seven minutes and forty-five seconds of pure brilliance ahead, the audience was about to witness yet another astounding delivery of the one song that won the hearts of everyone all around the world.</span></p><p><span style="color: #ced4d9;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jupiter” was the famed fourth movement of English composer Gustav Holst’s most celebrated orchestral suite: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This suite, after overcoming an initial wave of uncertainty and doubt from the public, developed a now undeniable popularity for itself. However, “Jupiter”, seemingly just one of the suite’s many planets, not only won over the public to earn its title as the most popular movement, but moreover gained recognition much larger than the whole of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This single movement had trailblazed the path for English music and influenced music to where it is in the present, all contributing towards its now highly acclaimed name among the genre of classical music. </span></span></p><p><span style="color: #ced4d9;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1921, just three years after premiering </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Holst was asked to adapt the emotional, stripped-back middle section of “Jupiter” to become the melody of a British anthem. However, it was unexpected that this anthem, “I Vow to Thee, My Country”, representing patriotism, unity, and peace in the era post World War I, would become an immense British staple. This adaptation then went on to be popularly seen at services for all of the UK, the Commonwealth, and even the high-profile. The anthem reached a level and reputation where it was sung at prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher’s funerals, as well as at Princess Diana of Wales’s 1981 royal wedding and memorials for commemoration (Linton 2022). In parallel to how this popular British anthem maintained its relevance into the present century, “Jupiter” had only grown in its favor and reputation. Having given its melody to the popular anthem, “Jupiter” transitioned from initially being perceived and critiqued by mostly only classical and orchestral enthusiasts, to then being exposed to all of England and further to international audiences. Through the form and introduction of this nationally acclaimed anthem, “Jupiter” became a global sensation and a household name, breaking down any remaining reservations that the orchestral scene had kept towards the piece. </span></span></p><p><span style="color: #ced4d9;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what was so special about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or more specifically “Jupiter,” that opened a massive uproar and debate within the musical community—and brought it to the level of unquestioned praise it holds today?</span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ced4d9;">In the early 1900s, a time when classical music was at a complete standstill with mostly the same Russian or Austrian names in the headlines, there was an evident lack of variation and excitement being brought to the expecting listeners. Even more, the momentary high that English music saw due to Edward Elgar had effectively diminished, leaving England with little to no relevance in the world of classical music. Gustav Holst, an English composer full of passion, saw this time as an opportunity to make a lasting impact on music: to establish a true foundation for English music, build his own name and personal sound, and bring a newfound thrill to the unmoving scene. Holst, in exchanges of letters to his fellow composer and friend Ralph Vaughan Williams, describes his positive and hopeful outlook on the state of the industry. He writes that for England the “unearthing of musical treasures is still going on”, that they “are laying a sure foundation of [their] national art”, and that they “are entering into [their] national musical heritage,” (Vaughan Williams and Holst 1959, 52). Holst’s confidence for music’s future in his country could seem baseless or overstated, however he in fact became the figure who gave England its chance for musical revival.</span></p><p><span style="color: #ced4d9;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holst was a musical mastermind and trailblazer. He advanced far past the limitations of his time, introducing postmodernist ideas into music decades before there was even a hint of a Postmodern era. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a prime example of how Holst “takes advantage of the Modern era’s structural flexibility and rule-breaking,” while also “embrace[ing] the Postmodern era through contradictions” (Germain 2023). At the time, he was amidst a German dominated era of classical music that saw similar structures and melodic patterns across each piece. Holst's adventurous exploration into new musical territory <a href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/critical-reading-assignment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ced4d9;">saw mixed opinions by the industry</a>, however due <em>The Planets</em>' sensational impact on listeners, in the end it garnered appreciation and lasting approval.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ced4d9;">“Jupiter”, however, features a new, unpredictable arrangement of themes that characterizes a lack of pattern, familiarity, and convention. An example of one theme that appears multiple times, yet not contributing to any classifiable structure for the piece, are the lines of interlocking, fast sixteenth note arpeggios in first and second violin sections. These space-like sounds embody a feeling of thrill in exploration of the planets in our solar system. This energetic theme is then later juxtaposed with an emotional, evocative, and undeniably beautiful melodic segment, famously known to be the climax of the piece. In this delicate theme, all of the instrument lines, strings, winds, brass, and percussion, contribute to a deep, full, and expressive folklike tune.</span></p><p><span style="color: #ced4d9;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holst’s contrasting yet complementing themes brought a contemporary feel to the movement, a concept that was polar opposite from the typical structured and systematic compositions that society had grown accustomed to. To this day, Holst’s masterpiece is frequently compared to favorites such as the universally cherished </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> soundtracks, as previously compared to in the <a href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/playlist-and-listening-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ced4d9;">music playlist.</a> This serves as a pleasant reminder as to how “Jupiter” and the entirety of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were pioneers in the world of classical music, from helping in its development, through shaping and enhancing society’s perception of the genre. </span></span></p><p><span style="color: #ced4d9;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether it is now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1999 at the full-packed Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra performance, or present day at a rerelease of a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> favorite, the audience will hear “Jupiter” and the influence of its composer Gustav Holst, and remember their legacies. Eighty years or a century of time has not tarnished "Jupiter's" reign as a moving, emotional, and unforgettable piece of music from our lifetime.</span></span></p><p class="align-right"><a href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/critical-reading-assignment.html">to The Roar of the Public &gt;&gt;</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
