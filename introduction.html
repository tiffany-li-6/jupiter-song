In many cases, it was surfacing social ideas of equality and identity that sparked change in music (Peak 2010). However in other times, it was the credit of specific songs, artists, or trends that made lasting impacts on genres and societal impression of music—-this was the case for English composer Gustav Holst’s “Jupiter.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jupiter: Bringer of Jollity”, or popularly known as “Jupiter”, is the star movement of Holst’s orchestral composition </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and also features as the star of this project</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its London premiere in 1918, the piece has gained worldwide popularity and praise for its unique musical components and its memorable central melody. Its recognition has lasted for over a century, and the public now knows Holst not only by his own works but also for his influences on music in media. Most notably of them, the well-loved movie soundtrack </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by John Williams shares many resemblances with Holst, for example the strong march theme or the dramatic orchestral textures. However, Holst reached other achievements with his works past attaining fame: he replenished the classical music scene for twentieth century England, simultaneously turning a new page for classical music as a genre. This project argues that Holst and his composition “Jupiter” changed the standard for classical music and how society has perceived this changing genre through history.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, my Music Playlist and Listening Guide serve as an introductory timeline documenting the components of “Jupiter’s” effect on classical music. The playlist-guide pair follows a roughly chronological order being music before Holst, Holst’s works, and then music after Holst. The playlist was organized in this way to help follow the journey of classical music, all the way from setting the scene of England’s bleak music condition in the early 1900s, to the release of Holst’s orchestral works and “Jupiter’s” popular adaptation into a British anthem, through to a modern media application showcasing Holst’s influences on the present day. The playlist and guide presents a brief yet informative look into the course of classic music in English history, highlighting “Jupiter’s” impact through contrasting songs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is my Music Review, an essay which takes a far closer look into the story of “Jupiter”, and the journey it took to become the renowned song it is today. This essay, a dive into the history of the song, firstly establishes the state of the classical music scene before Holst entered the picture. Discovered in letters exchanged with his fellow composer and friend Ralph Vaughan Williams, Holst comments on the lacking presence of English music and expresses his desire to change the course of music for England (Vaughan Williams &amp; Holst 1959). I then dive into the modern directions that Holst took in his composition of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and also refer to the musical choices that he made to achieve this impact. Within “Jupiter”, Holst implemented a variety of instrumental techniques in addition to an unconventional loose structure to the movement, all of which added to its unique yet bold sound and outstanding reception within the field of classical music (Martin 2021). The combination of these tactics and motives directed “Jupiter” in successfully challenging the standing norms of classical music and winning over the opinion of the public.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following sequentially is my Critical Reading Assignment, where I analyze a book written about the entire suite </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the text having a focus on the piece’s reception and reviews–from its premiere and the initial stages of its contention of classical music’s standing expectations (Greene 1995). This essay focuses on listeners’ mixed reception due to Holst’s modernistic choices and further emphasizes the societal norms that Holst overcame through his career. However, the essay overarchingly portrays the society’s overarching positive, joyous sentiment towards </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To conclude my project, for my Final Major Essay I chose to make a cover of the reputable British anthem “I Vow To Thee My Country”, in the form of rewriting the lyrics and singing the new arrangement. At this point in my project, the large part of my ideas have been analysis of or comments towards songs or scholarly works about my song. My writing has gone from synthesizing a timeline of Holst’s contributions to music, to focusing specifically on the trailblazing quality of his work </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through analyzing public reception, and then lastly diving deep into the actual musical elements and choices that Holst made within “Jupiter” and their contribution to the success of the piece. These essays are informative in many different categories of the song, including its history, influence, and musical techniques, however, what felt lacking from this project was a display or representation of the widespread appreciation and love that the people, whether English, musician, or just an ordinary listener, truly feel for Holst and his accomplishments. My rewritten lyrics of the staple British anthem show strong admiration for Holst through praising his achievements in the form of a song. This universal feeling of love held for Holst is representative of society in the past, present, and lasting on into the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this progression of works, in the form of both texts and media, I painted a map of “Jupiter” with its context and significance in history. Navigate through this project using the forward arrows located on each page, the pages ordered to progressively dig deeper into the music, and to immerse the visitor through a variety of topics and mediums.</span></p><p class="align-right"><a href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/playlist-and-listening-guide.html">to The History of English Music &gt;&gt;</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://tiffany-li-6.github.io/jupiter-song/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
